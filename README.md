Bulky Book Web App 
A Bulky Book Web App contains a home page and a target page called the category page, where you can do some processes like create, edit, and delete categories with some validations.

Tools used:
C#, ASP.NET Core MVC (.net 6)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap

I learned some concepts by following the freeCodeCamp course:
Dependency Injection (DI), Model Controller View (MVC) architecture, Routine, Tag Helpers in (.net 6), and Data Annotation.
